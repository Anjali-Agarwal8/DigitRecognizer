The dataset contains 28*28 pixel values for images of 0-9 digits. A CNN model has been trained to classify the test images. The model was optimized using NAdam optimizer and loss was calculated using KL_divergence function. For improving the accuracy of the model images were preprocessed and data was augmented using variations of the images.
